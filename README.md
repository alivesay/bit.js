# bit.js
An experimental JavaScript game engine...with Blast Processing!


A fun winter project where I make yet another attempt at a game engine and get detoured down a rabbit hole in the form of a custom JS class system.

### BitObject
[BitObject](https://github.com/alivesay/bit.js/blob/master/src/core/bit_object.js) attempts to provide an object class supporting:
* multiple inheritance
* mixins
* extensions
* interfaces
* introspection
* object pooling
